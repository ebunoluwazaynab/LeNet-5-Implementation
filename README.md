# LeNet-5 Implementation with MNIST

## Project Overview
This project implements the classic LeNet-5 convolutional neural network to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. It demonstrates the fundamentals of building and training a CNN and provides visual insights into the model's performance.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ebunoluwazaynab/LeNet-5-Implementation.git
cd LeNet-5-Implementation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Navigate to the `notebooks` directory and run the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook LeNet_5_Implementation.ipynb
```

## Features

- Detailed implementation of the LeNet-5 architecture.
- Training and evaluation performed on the MNIST dataset.
- Accuracy and loss visualization for model training.
- Example predictions from the trained model.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
